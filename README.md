# DesignPattern
C++ implementation 

you cmake build and run seperately in vscode simplely!
if you want to debug the target, just modify the launch.json in folder .vscode

notice:
I choose gcc and nvcc kit to build my cmake target, with .cu files not finished yet.
You can ignore .cu and .py for now.
